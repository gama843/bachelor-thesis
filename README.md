Vision-language models have made significant strides in interpreting and generating descriptions from visual data. However, their ability to perform complex relational reasoning remains a challenge. Relational reasoning involves understanding the relationships between different entities within a context, which is crucial for tasks such as visual question answering and scene understanding. Santoro et al. proposed a simple neural network module designed specifically to enhance relational reasoning in neural networks [1]. This thesis aims to explore the effectiveness of such modules when integrated into vision-language models.
